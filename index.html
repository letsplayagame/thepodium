		Being first is probably one of the best feelings in the world. You put your heart and soul to whatever you do, and when the day comes, you beat everybody out there who try to do better than you. You are the best. You deserved it. Enjoy it while lasts, because being the first is as far as you can go. From that day on, all you have to do is defend your place.

		If you are second, you are only the first in a long line of loosers. Nobody cares how many people you beat. There is still a person out there who is better than you. You may be super duper fast, or ultra mega talented, but all of it doesn't matter, because you are not there yet. You should keep working hard, and not only you gotta be better next time, you have to be better than him.

		You've made it. You got a medal now. You are pretty sure that nobody will remember your name the next day, but you will take that trophy to your home, put it up to somewhere, and for the next couple of decades, you will tell everybody how hard it was to compete that day, and how you got awarded. You tell everybody that life is not about being number one but putting the efford but who are you kidding. Remember, this is not just the third place, this is the last place in the podium.
